== Frequently asked questions ==


= Portfolio Image not showing? =
It's a common problem. We have an option in plugin setting for define image width & height. Try to upload a larger image than you define on the setting.

Go to Portfolio -> Portfolio Settings. Here you will find the option for choosing the portfolio column.
